# M5GP 
M5GP Project
Implementation of Genetic Programming algorithm in CUDA.
```
This is a Python implementation of  M5GP programming algorithm.
```
***
## Description:  
M5GP implements a Scikit-Learn type interface using Python, the necessary methods are available for its evaluation and use, in addition a Regressor type object compatible with Scikit-Learn in Python was defined.

Train/fit functions were defined in a base class of type Regressor.

Established a dictionary of type hyper_params or a list of dictionaries specifying the hyperparameter search space

A function has been defined that returns a sympy-compatible string that specifies the final model and can be manipulated in sympy.

The integration of the Numba library and cuML within M5GP was carried out with the objective of using it as a variant of evaluation of the models obtained through GP and to improve the efficiency and suitability of the results.

## Parameters:  

Modify the parameters in the configuration.ini file accordingly, to adjust to the desired evolutionary conditions

| Name     								| Values   | Description|
| -------- 								| -------- |------------|
|1.  Number of generations				| 1024     |Total number of iterations of the main evolutionary loop. |
|2.  Population Size					| 1024     |Number of individuals in the population; also specifies the number of auxiliary random trees used in GSGP mutation operation.|
|3.  Max Individual Length      		| 1024     |Size (number of genes) of each individual in the population and the auxiliary population.|
|4.  FunctionRatio                      | 0.5      |Probability of selecting a function, otherwise a terminal element is selected when generating an individual.|
|5.  VariableRatio                      | 0.5      |Probability of selecting a variable, otherwise a constant terminal is selected when generating an individual.|
|6.  Maximun Random Constant			| 10       |Maximum value of the random constants used. Whatever the value, negative constants of the same magnitude are also generated.|

## Data Description:  
It is important that the problem data are not separated by ",". Please separate your data by a blank space " ".

## Software code languajes, tools, and services used
```
PYTHON, SCIKIT LEARN, NUMBA, CUML, SRBENCH
```
## Compilation requirements, operating enviroments & dependencies 
```
PYTHON, CONDA, CUML 

How to compile.

To run gsgpCuda it is necessary to add a name for the output file generation, as shown in the example.

./GsgpCuda.x -train_data <train_file_name>.txt -test_data <test_file_name>.txt -output_model <model_name>

<train_file_name>.txt: This file must contain the training data used to compute fitness and given in a format of space-seperated values with n columns, where the first n-1 columns are the input features and the last column is the target variable.
<test_file_name>.txt:  This file must contain the test data used to evalaute the best individual at each generation. this data does not influence the evolutionary/training process, and must be given in the same format as the training data.
If no test data is available, the user can indicate the same file as the training data to assure proper excecution, this does not afffect model evolution.
<model_name>.csv: This file contains the information needed to apply the best model found by gsgpcuda on new data (make new predictions or inferences). other auxiliary files are also generated and required.

GsgpCuda generates the following output files, which are located in the log folder

    <model_name>_initialPopulation.csv: This file will store the individuals of the initial population.
    <model_name>_randomTrees.csv: This file will store the individuals of the auxiliary population.
    <model_name>_fitnessTrain.csv: This file will store the error of the best individual in each generation with training data.
    <model_name>_fitnessTest.csv: This file will store the error of the best individual in each generation with test data.
    <model_name>_processing_time.csv: This file stores the processing times in seconds of the various modules of the algorithm. 

```

## How to make new predictions (inference) with the best model found
```
To make new predictions with the best model generated by gsgpcuda it is necessary to provide the name of the model by command line, the second parameter indicates the name of the data file, and the third parameter indicates the name of the file to save the output values generated by the model.

./GsgpCuda.x -model <model_name> -input_data <new_data>.txt -prediction_output <predicted_values>.csv

<model_name>: this file contains the information needed to test the model generated by gsgpcuda.
<new_data>.txt: this file must contain the new unseen data for testing the model. the file should have the same number of columns as the number of input features in the train.txt file used to train the data, without the target column.
<predicted_values>.csv: this file will store the output values generated by the model when tested on the data in newdata.txt.
